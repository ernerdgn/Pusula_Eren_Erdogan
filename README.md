Pusula Talent Academy - Data Science Case Study

This repository contains the code, data set and documentation for the Pusula Talent Academy - Data Science Case Study.

I was expected to work on a physical medicine & rehabilitation data set consisting of 2235 observations and 13 features. The goal is to conduct in depth EDA and make the data ready for potential predictive modeling.

To run the notebooks, simply click on the script, then in the notebook tab, click Open in Colab to open the notebook in Colab.

After examination of the final output, i also prepared a refactored version of the code to handle pre processing. Purpose of this is to create a more readable and organised code. Then i wrote a script that compares two xlsx files to see that if they hold the same data regarding the column order. Both of the files are containing the same data. Comparison script is a py file, which can be run with the default command `python compare.py`.
