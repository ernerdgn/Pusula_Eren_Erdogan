Pusula Talent Academy - Data Science Case Study

This repository contains the code, data set and documentation for the Pusula Talent Academy - Data Science Case Study.

I was expected to work on a physical medicine & rehabilitation data set consisting of 2235 observations and 13 features. The goal is to conduct in depth EDA and make the data ready for potential predictive modeling.
